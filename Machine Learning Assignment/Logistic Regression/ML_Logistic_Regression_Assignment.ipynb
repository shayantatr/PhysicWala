        "\n",
        "**Answer:** **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** is a **statistical method** used to model the relationship between two variables — one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) — by fitting a straight line to the observed data.\n",

        "\n",
        "In simple terms, SLR estimates how much the dependent variable\n",

        "1. **Prediction:**   \n",
        "Estimate or predict the value of 𝑌 for a given value of 𝑋.  \n",

        "2. **Understanding relationships:**  \n",
        "Determine whether and how strongly two variables are linearly related.  \n",

        "**Question 2:** What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** The **key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** ensure that the model’s estimates are valid, reliable, and interpretable. Violating these assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions or biased predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the **five main assumptions** explained clearly:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **1. Linearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaning:** The relationship between the independent variable 𝑋 and the dependent variable 𝑌 must be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **In other words:** The change in 𝑌 should be proportional to the change in 𝑋.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How to check:** Plot a scatter plot of 𝑋 vs. 𝑌. The data points should roughly form a straight-line pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **2. Independence of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaning:** The residuals (errors) — differences between observed and predicted values — must be **independent** of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why it matters:** If errors are correlated (e.g., in time-series data), predictions and statistical tests become unreliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How to check:** Use the **Durbin-Watson test** (especially for time-series data).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaning:** The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of **𝑋**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why it matters:** If the spread of residuals increases or decreases with **𝑋** (called heteroscedasticity), it can distort standard errors and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How to check:** Plot residuals vs. predicted values — they should form a random scatter (not a funnel shape).\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **4. Normality of Errors**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaning:** The residuals should be **approximately normally distributed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Why it matters:** This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **How to check:** Use a **histogram** or **Q–Q plot** of residuals — they should follow a bell-shaped curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 **5. No (or minimal) Multicollinearity**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In **simple** linear regression (only one independent variable), this isn’t an issue.\n",
        "\n",
