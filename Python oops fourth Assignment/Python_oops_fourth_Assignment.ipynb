        "**Ques 1.** What is Object-Oriented Programming `(OOP)`?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "oops is based on several key concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class). This hides the internal state of an object and only exposes necessary functionality.\n",
        "2.   **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance:** Creating a new class (child class) from an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, promoting code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way. This allows for flexibility and extensibility in your code.\n",
        "In essence, OOP helps in organizing and structuring code by modeling real-world entities as objects, making programs more modular, maintainable, and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 2.** What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a class like a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter itself doesn't become the cookie, but it defines the shape and size of all the cookies you make with it. Similarly, a class doesn't contain data itself, but it specifies what kind of data its objects will hold and what actions those objects can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For example**, you could have a Car class that defines attributes like color, make, and model, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(). When you create an object from the Car class (like my_car = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\", \"Camry\")), that object will have its own specific values for color, make, and model, and you can call the methods on that specific car object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 3.** What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a real-world entity or an instance of a class. It is a fundamental unit of OOP that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single package.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects, and an object as a specific instance created from that blueprint. For example, if \"Car\" is a class, then your specific car with a certain color, make, and model is an object of the Car class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects have:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **State:** This is represented by the attributes or data fields of the object. For a car object, its state might be its color, make, model, current speed, etc.\n",
        "2.  **Behavior:** This is represented by the methods or functions that operate on the object's data. For a car object, its behavior might include starting the engine, stopping, accelerating, braking, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objects interact with each other by sending messages (calling methods). This interaction allows for the creation of complex systems by combining simpler objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, an object is a concrete realization of a class, possessing its own unique state and the ability to perform actions defined by the class's methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 4.** What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that are often confused but serve distinct purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Abstraction:**\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or functionalities to the user.\n",
        "    *   **Goal:** To simplify the view of an object by showing only what is necessary and relevant, while hiding the underlying complexity. It focuses on the \"what\" an object does, not the \"how\".\n",
        "    *   **How it's achieved:** Through abstract classes, abstract methods, and interfaces (in some languages, though Python uses abstract base classes). It defines a common interface for a set of related objects.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** When you use a television remote, you press buttons like \"Power,\" \"Volume Up,\" or \"Channel Down.\" You don't need to know how the remote internally sends signals or how the television processes them. The remote provides an abstract interface to interact with the television.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). It also involves controlling access to the internal data to protect it from external modification.\n",
        "    *   **Goal:** To protect the data from being accessed and modified directly from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended side effects. It combines data and behavior into a single unit.\n",
        "    *   **How it's achieved:** By defining classes and using access modifiers (like private or protected, though Python uses conventions like leading underscores to indicate intent for private attributes). It keeps related data and methods together.\n",
        "    *   **Example:** In a `BankAccount` class, you would bundle the `balance` attribute with methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. You wouldn't allow direct access to change the `balance`; instead, you would use the provided methods, which might include validation or other logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences Summarized:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Purpose:** Abstraction is about hiding complexity and showing only essentials. Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods and controlling access to the data.\n",
        "*   **Focus:** Abstraction focuses on the external view of an object (what it does). Encapsulation focuses on the internal structure of an object (how data and methods are organized and protected).\n",
        "*   **Relationship:** Encapsulation is often a mechanism that helps achieve abstraction. By bundling data and methods and controlling access, you can hide the internal implementation details and present a simplified interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, abstraction is about simplifying what you see, while encapsulation is about containing and protecting the internal workings of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 5.** What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`). These methods are not meant to be called directly by the programmer but are invoked automatically by Python in response to certain operations or events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods allow you to customize the behavior of your objects and classes to work with built-in Python functions and operators. They enable features like:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Object initialization:** The `__init__` method is called when an object is created, allowing you to set initial values for its attributes.\n",
        "*   **String representation:** The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods define how an object should be represented as a string, which is useful for printing and debugging.\n",
        "*   **Operator overloading:** Dunder methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc., allow you to define how your objects should behave when used with arithmetic and other operators.\n",
        "*   **Container emulation:** Dunder methods like `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, etc., allow your objects to behave like containers (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
        "*   **Context management:** The `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods enable your objects to be used with the `with` statement for resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing dunder methods, you can make your custom objects behave more like built-in Python types, making your code more intuitive and Pythonic.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 6.** Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the **child class** or **derived class**) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called the **parent class** or **base class**).\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like real-world inheritance: a child inherits certain traits from their parents. In OOP, a child class inherits the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Parent Class (Base Class):** The class from which other classes inherit. It defines the common attributes and methods that will be shared.\n",
        "*   **Child Class (Derived Class):** A new class created from a parent class. It inherits all the public and protected members of the parent class. It can also have its own unique attributes and methods, or it can override (redefine) methods inherited from the parent.\n",
        "*   **Code Reusability:** Inheritance promotes code reusability because you don't have to write the same attributes and methods multiple times in different classes if they share common characteristics.\n",
        "*   **Establishing Relationships:** Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. For example, a \"Dog is an Animal,\" a \"Car is a Vehicle.\" This hierarchical structure helps organize code and model real-world relationships.\n",
        "*   **Extensibility:** Inheritance makes it easier to extend existing code. You can create new classes that inherit from existing ones and add new functionality or modify existing behavior without changing the original class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you have a `Vehicle` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, and a method `start_engine()`. You can then create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`. The `Car` class automatically gets the `make`, `model`, and `start_engine()` from `Vehicle`. You can then add car-specific attributes like `number_of_doors` or methods like `open_trunk()` to the `Car` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a powerful tool for creating a well-structured and organized codebase, promoting reusability and making it easier to manage complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 7.** What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Polymorphism, in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own way. The word \"polymorphism\" comes from Greek and means \"many shapes\" or \"many forms.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP, polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes that are related by inheritance through a common interface. This means you can write code that works with a base class, and that code will automatically work with any derived class that implements the same methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key aspects of polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Common Interface:** Polymorphism relies on a common method name or interface defined in a base class or an abstract class.\n",
        "*   **Different Implementations:** Derived classes provide their own specific implementations of the common method.\n",
        "*   **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism makes your code more flexible and easier to extend. You can add new derived classes without having to modify the code that uses the base class.\n",
        "*   **Dynamic Binding (Late Binding):** The decision of which specific method implementation to call is made at runtime, based on the actual type of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a base class `Shape` with a method `draw()`. You can have derived classes like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`, each with their own implementation of the `draw()` method that draws the specific shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 8.** How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to the internal states and behaviors (data and methods) of a class. It is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming and is implemented using:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access Modifiers\n",
        "\n",
        ">Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like some other languages (e.g., private, protected, public), but it uses naming conventions to indicate access levels.\n",
        "\n",
        ">a. Public Members:\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Accessible from anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Default for all members.\n",
        "\n",
        ">b. Protected Members (by convention):\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Prefix with a single underscore _.\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Meant to be used only within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        ">c. Private Members:\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Prefix with double underscore __.\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Name mangling makes them harder to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Getter and Setter Methods\n",
        "\n",
        ">These provide controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Using @property Decorators\n",
        "\n",
        ">Pythonic way to use getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 9.** What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the attributes (data) of the newly created object with initial values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor method in Python is always named `__init__` (with double underscores before and after). This naming convention makes it a \"dunder\" method (double underscore method), which Python recognizes as a special method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Object Creation:** When you create an object from a class (e.g., `my_object = MyClass(...)`), Python automatically calls the `__init__` method of that class.\n",
        "2. **`self` Parameter:** The first parameter of the `__init__` method is conventionally named `self`. This `self` refers to the instance of the object being created. It's through `self` that you can access and set the attributes of the object.\n",
        "3. **Initialization:** Inside the `__init__` method, you typically assign values to the object's attributes using `self.attribute_name = value`. These values can be passed as arguments to the constructor when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an object of Person\n",
        "p = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(p.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
        "print(p.age)   # Output: 30\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 10.** What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Python, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that serve different purposes and are defined differently than regular instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Method**\n",
        "\n",
        ">- A **class method** is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        ">- It takes cls as the first parameter (which refers to the class itself).\n",
        "\n",
        ">- It can access or modify class state that applies across all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "➤ Use @classmethod decorator to define one.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    class Employee:\n",
        "    raise_amount = 1.05  # class variable\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, salary):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.salary = salary\n",
        "\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def set_raise_amount(cls, amount):\n",
        "        cls.raise_amount = amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Usage\n",
        "    Employee.set_raise_amount(1.10)\n",
        "    print(Employee.raise_amount)  # Output: 1.10\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Static Method**\n",
        "\n",
        ">- A **static method** is a method that does not receive an implicit first argument (self or cls).\n",
        "\n",
        ">- It cannot modify object or class state.\n",
        "\n",
        ">- It's used for utility functions that logically belong to the class, but don’t need class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Ques 11.** What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Method overloading is a concept in some programming languages where you can have multiple methods with the same name in a class, but they have different parameters (different number of arguments or different types of arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Python does **not** support method overloading in the same way that languages like Java or C++ do. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a Python class, the last one defined will override the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Python doesn't have true method overloading, you can achieve similar behavior using a few techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Default arguments:** You can give parameters default values so that a method can be called with different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variable-length arguments:** Using `*args` and `**kwargs` allows a method to accept a variable number of positional and keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Type checking and conditional logic:** Inside a single method, you can check the types or number of arguments passed and perform different actions accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "I hope this clarifies the concept of method overloading in Python!\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques 12.** What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Method overriding is an OOP concept where a **subclass** provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the **subclass** to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method without altering the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** The core of method overriding is inheritance. A subclass inherits methods from its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Same Signature:** The method in the subclass must have the exact same name, number, and type of parameters (the method's \"signature\") as the method in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**New Implementation:** The subclass then provides its own, new implementation for that method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** When you call the overridden method on an object of the subclass, the subclass's version is executed instead of the superclass's version. This is a key aspect of polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explain:**\n",
        "\n",

        "**Ques 13.** What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** A property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that provides a \"Pythonic\" way to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for a class attribute. It allows you to access or modify a class method as if it were a regular attribute, enabling you to add logic and control behind the scenes without changing the public interface of your class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the @property decorator works**\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator simplifies the process of managing class attributes, which is a key concept in object-oriented programming called encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Ques 14.** Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Polymorphism is important in OOP for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flexibility and Extensibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes through a common interface. This makes your code more flexible because you can easily add new classes that inherit from a base class without having to modify the existing code that uses the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Code Reusability:** By using a common interface, you can write functions or methods that can operate on a variety of objects, reducing the need to write separate code for each class. This promotes code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintainability:** Polymorphism makes your code easier to maintain. If you need to change the implementation of a specific behavior, you only need to modify the method in the relevant subclass. The code that uses the polymorphic interface doesn't need to be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Simplified Code:** Polymorphism simplifies your code by allowing you to treat related objects in a uniform way. You don't need to know the specific type of an object at compile time; the correct method implementation is determined at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Easier Debugging:** With polymorphism, you can often debug code more easily because you can focus on the behavior of the base class and its methods, rather than having to trace the execution through many different class-specific methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, polymorphism allows for more generic and adaptable code, making your programs easier to write, understand, and maintain. It's a powerful tool for creating flexible and extensible object-oriented designs.\n",

        "**Ques 15.** What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but have no implementation. Subclasses of an abstract class are required to provide implementations for all abstract methods defined in the parent abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module is used to define abstract classes and methods. The `ABC` class from this module is the base class for defining abstract classes, and the `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to declare abstract methods.\n",

        "**Ans.** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that contribute to writing better, more maintainable, and scalable code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Modularity:** OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, self-contained units called objects. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Reusability:** Through concepts like inheritance, you can reuse existing classes and their functionalities, reducing the need to write code from scratch. This saves time and effort and promotes consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Maintainability:** Because objects are independent units, changes made within one object are less likely to affect other parts of the program. This makes the code easier to maintain and update.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Extensibility:** OOP makes it easier to extend existing code. You can add new features or modify existing ones by creating new classes that inherit from existing ones, without altering the original code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Flexibility (Polymorphism):** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface. This makes the code more flexible and adaptable to different situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Data Security (Encapsulation):** Encapsulation helps in protecting the data within an object from unauthorized access or modification. This ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Improved Collaboration:** OOP's modular nature makes it easier for multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, as each can focus on their assigned objects.\n",

        "**Ans.** In Python, `__str__` and `__repr__` are special methods (dunder methods) that define how objects are represented as strings. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`__str__(self)`:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** To provide a user-friendly, human-readable string representation of an object.\n",

        "2.  **`__repr__(self)`:**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** To provide an unambiguous, developer-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "    *   **Called by:** The `repr()` built-in function, the interactive interpreter when evaluating an expression, and implicitly when `__str__` is not defined.\n",

        "\n",
        "It's generally recommended to define both `__str__` and `__repr__` for your classes. If you only define one, define `__repr__` as it can serve as a fallback for `__str__`. If you define both, make sure `__repr__` provides a more detailed and unambiguous representation than `__str__`.\n",

It's most commonly used to ensure that parent class methods, like the __init__ constructor, are properly executed when a subclass is being initialized.  This prevents a subclass from completely overriding its parent's methods, allowing for proper collaboration and extension of behavior.\n",

This is crucial for setting up attributes inherited from the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Method Overriding and Extension:** When a subclass overrides a method from its parent, super() allows you to call the original parent method before or after adding new functionality. This lets you extend the parent's behavior rather than completely replacing it. For example, a Dog class might inherit from an Animal class. The speak() method in Dog could call super().speak() to get the general animal sound, then add its specific \"bark\" sound.\n",
