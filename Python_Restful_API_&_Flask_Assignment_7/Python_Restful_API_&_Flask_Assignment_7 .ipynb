        "\n",
        "**Ques-1.** What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for two computer systems to communicate over the internet using simple, standard rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "It follows the **REST architecture style**, which is based on these principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Client-Server:** The client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) requests resources, and the server provides them.\n",
        "2. **Stateless:** Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed. The server does not remember past requests.\n",
        "3. **Resources:** Everything is treated as a resource (like users, products, or orders), and each resource has a unique URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  - /users → all users\n",
        "  - /users/1 → user with ID 1\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **HTTP Methods:** RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods for actions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET → Retrieve data\n",
        "- POST → Create new data\n",
        "- PUT/PATCH → Update existing data\n",
        "- DELETE → Remove data\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Format:** Usually, RESTful APIs send and receive data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), but XML or other formats can also be used.\n",
        "6. **Stateless Communication:** Each request is independent—no session is stored on the server between requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are using an online shop’s REST API:\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET /products → Get a list of products\n",
        "- POST /products → Add a new product\n",
        "- PUT /products/5 → Update product with ID 5\n",
        "- DELETE /products/5 → Delete product with ID 5\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques-2.** Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** An **API specification** is a detailed description of how an API works.\n",
        "It defines:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **endpoints/URLs** of the API (e.g., /users, /products).\n",
        "- The **methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) allowed on each endpoint.\n",
        "- The **data format** (JSON, XML, etc.) to send or receive.\n",
        "- The **rules** (authentication, parameters, response codes).\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as a blueprint/manual for developers to understand how to use the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques-3.** What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** **Flask** is a **lightweight Python web framework** used to create web apps and APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Flask is popular for APIs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Very **simple and easy** to learn.\n",
        "- Provides built-in **routing** system.\n",
        "- Works well with **JSON data** (common in APIs).\n",
        "- Flexible (you can add only what you need).\n",
        "- Large **community support** and lots of extensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is often used for **small to medium APIs** and quick prototyping.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques-4.** What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** **Routing** means connecting a **URL (endpoint)** to a **function** in Flask.\n",
        "**For example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- /hello → a function that returns “Hello World”.\n",
        "- /users → a function that returns a list of users.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, **routing tells Flask which function to run when a certain URL is requested.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques-5.** How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Here’s the basic code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)   # create Flask app\n",

        "2. Create an app object.\n",
        "3. Use @app.route() to define a route.\n",
        "4. Create a function to handle that route.\n",
        "5. Run the app.\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "**Ques-6.** What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** HTTP methods in RESTful APIs are used to define the type of action you want to perform on a resource. These methods correspond to the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing a standardized way to interact with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common HTTP methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- GET → Read data (example: get all users).\n",
        "- POST → Create new data (example: add a new user).\n",
        "- PUT → Update existing data (replace whole resource).\n",
        "- PATCH → Partially update data (modify part of resource).\n",
        "- DELETE → Remove data.\n",

        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques-7.** What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL path to a Python function. When a user navigates to the specified URL in their browser (or a client makes a request to that URL), the decorated function is executed, and its return value is sent back as the response to the client. It's the core mechanism for defining endpoints in a Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "The @app.route() decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Defines the **URL path** of an endpoint.\n",
        "- Connects that URL to a **function**.\n",
        "- Tells Flask: “When someone visits this URL, run this function.”\n",

        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "@app.route(\"/hello\")\n",
        "def say_hello():\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ques-8.** What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Difference between GET and POST HTTP methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **GET**\n",
        "  \n",
        "  * Used to request data from a server.\n",
        "  * Parameters are sent in the URL query string (e.g., /api?name=John).\n",
        "  * Should not change data on the server (safe and idempotent).\n",
        "  * Example: retrieving a list of users.\n",
        "* **POST**\n",
        "  \n",
        "  * Used to send data to the server to create or modify resources.\n",
        "  * Data is sent in the request body, not visible in the URL.\n",
        "  * Commonly used for form submissions, API data creation.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "* Use try-except blocks in your code.\n",
        "* Flask provides @app.errorhandler() for custom error handling.\n",
        "* You can return structured error responses (like JSON).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",

        "**Ques-10.** How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Flask itself doesn't have built-in database connectivity. You connect Flask to a SQL database using various Python libraries and Flask extensions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides a high-level API to interact with databases.\n",
        "* **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: A Flask extension that integrates SQLAlchemy seamlessly with Flask, simplifying configuration and common database operations.\n",
        "* **Raw drivers**: You can use specific database drivers (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL, `sqlite3` for SQLite) directly, though an ORM is usually preferred for complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example with SQLite:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "import sqlite3\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that provides SQLAlchemy support for Flask applications.  Its role is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Simplify configuration**: Easily configure database connections within your Flask app.\n",
        "* **Provide a session management system**: Manages database sessions, ensuring proper connection handling and transaction management.\n",
        "* **Integrate with Flask's context**: Makes database objects available within Flask's application and request contexts.\n",
        "* **Offer convenient helpers**: Provides helper methods for common ORM operations like querying, adding, and committing data.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** **Flask Blueprints** are a way to organize your Flask application into smaller, reusable components. They allow you to group related routes, error handlers, and other application parts together.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How they are useful:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Modularity:** Break down large applications into smaller, manageable units.\n",
        "* **Reusability:** Create reusable components that can be registered with different Flask applications.\n",

        "**Ques-13.** What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The `request` object in Flask is a global object that holds all the incoming request data from the client. It's available within your view functions and allows you to access information about the current request, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Form data:** Data submitted through HTML forms (e.g., `request.form['username']`).\n",
        "* **Query parameters:** Data passed in the URL after a question mark (e.g., `request.args.get('id')`).\n",
        "* **JSON data:** Data sent in the request body as JSON (e.g., `request.json`).\n",
        "* **Headers:** HTTP headers sent by the client (e.g., `request.headers.get('User-Agent')`).\n",
        "* **Files:** Uploaded files (e.g., `request.files['myfile']`).\n",
        "* **Method:** The HTTP method of the request (e.g., `request.method`).\n",

        "**Ques-14.** How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** To create a basic RESTful API endpoint in Flask, you typically define a route and a corresponding function that handles requests to that route. You can use the `@app.route()` decorator and specify the HTTP methods allowed for that endpoint.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ques-15.** What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Flask's `jsonify()` function is a helper function that converts a Python dictionary or list into a JSON formatted response with the appropriate `Content-Type` header (`application/json`). Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of returning JSON data from Flask view functions, which is essential for building RESTful APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of manually serializing data to JSON and setting headers, you can simply pass your data to `jsonify()`, and it handles the rest.\n",

        "**Ans.** Flask's `url_for()` function is used for **URL building**. It takes the name of a view function as its first argument and any variable parts of the URL rule as keyword arguments. It then returns the URL for that specific function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purposes of `url_for()` are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Avoiding hardcoding URLs:** If you change a URL rule in your application, you don't need to update all the places where you link to it. `url_for()` generates the correct URL based on the function name.\n",

        "**Ans.** HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request. They indicate the outcome of the request and provide standardized information about whether the request was successful, redirected, or resulted in an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why they are important in a Flask API:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Communication:** They tell the client what happened with their request (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).\n",
        "* **Standardization:** They provide a common language for APIs and clients to communicate effectively.\n",
        "* **Debugging:** They help developers understand and debug issues with API requests and responses.\n",
        "* **Client-side handling:** Clients (like mobile apps or frontend frameworks) can use status codes to determine how to handle the response (e.g., display an error message for a 4xx status code).\n",
        "\n",
        "In Flask, you can return a status code along with your response data, typically as the second argument of the `return` statement:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** To handle POST requests in Flask, you need to specify `'POST'` in the `methods` argument of the `@app.route()` decorator for the desired endpoint.

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Securing a Flask API involves multiple layers of protection to prevent unauthorized access and common web vulnerabilities. Key security measures include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Authentication:** Verify the identity of the client making the request. Common methods include:\n",
        "    * **API Keys:** Simple tokens for basic access control.\n",
        "    * **Token-based Authentication (e.g., JWT):** More robust for stateless APIs.\n",
        "    * **OAuth2:** For delegated authorization (e.g., allowing third-party apps to access user data).\n",
        "* **Authorization:** Determine what the authenticated client is allowed to do. Implement role-based or permission-based access control.\n",
        "* **HTTPS/SSL:** Encrypt communication between the client and the server to protect data in transit.\n",
        "* **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all incoming data to prevent Injection attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, etc.).\n",
        "* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame.\n",
        "* **Error Handling:** Provide generic error messages to avoid leaking sensitive information in detailed error responses.\n",
        "* **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configure CORS headers to control which domains are allowed to access your API.\n",
        "* **Protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Use tokens or other mechanisms to prevent attackers from tricking users into making unintended requests.\n",
        "* **Keeping dependencies updated:** Regularly update Flask and other libraries to patch security vulnerabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Flask extensions like Flask-Login, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-CORS, and Flask-Limiter can help implement many of these security features.\n",

        "**Ques-22.**What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Flask-RESTful is a Flask extension that provides a more structured and opinionated way to build RESTful APIs. Its significance lies in simplifying common API development tasks and promoting best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key benefits of using Flask-RESTful:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Resource Abstraction:** It introduces the concept of Resources, which are classes that represent your API endpoints. This helps organize your code by grouping related HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for a specific resource within a single class.\n",
        "* **Request Parsing:** Provides convenient parsers to handle and validate incoming request data (arguments, form data, JSON).\n",
        "* **Serialization:** Helps in formatting output data (e.g., to JSON) easily.\n",
        "* **Error Handling:** Simplifies handling and returning consistent error responses.\n",
        "* **Swagger/OpenAPI Integration:** Makes it easier to generate API documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "While you can build RESTful APIs with just Flask, Flask-RESTful provides helpful abstractions and tools that can make development faster and the codebase more maintainable, especially for larger APIs.\n",

        "**Ques-23.** What is the role of Flask's session object?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Flask's `session` object is a dictionary-like object that allows you to store data specific to a user's session across multiple requests. Since HTTP is stateless, the session object is crucial for maintaining state information for individual users as they interact with your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "The role of the `session` object is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Maintain user state:** Store information that needs to persist between requests for a particular user (e.g., logged-in status, user ID, shopping cart contents, language preference).\n",
        "* **Associate data with a specific browser/client:** Flask uses cookies (specifically, a signed cookie containing a session ID) to identify a user's session.\n",
        "* **Provide a secure way to store small amounts of user data:** The session data is stored on the server, and only a secure, signed cookie is sent to the client, making it more secure than storing sensitive data directly in client-side cookies.\n",
